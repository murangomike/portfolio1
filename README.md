**Machine Learning Portfolio**

**Overview**

Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio! This repository is a showcase of my skills and projects in various machine learning techniques,
including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Neural Networks, Keras, TensorFlow, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Linear Models.
Here, you will find detailed implementations, explanations, and visualizations of different models applied to diverse datasets. 
This portfolio highlights my proficiency in both classical machine learning algorithms and advanced deep learning frameworks.
